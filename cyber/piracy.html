<div id="color_two"><h3>What is Piracy?</h3></div><div id="left"><h4>Piracy is an interesting subject because there are many different laws and opinions on this issue. Copyright law protects a writer (or artist, etc.) by giving them the sole rights to sell and reproduce their material. When a user legally purchases a CD or song on iTunes or other media, they are buying the right to use the media under restrictions by the producer or record label. This normally means that it is illegal under copyright law to copy said CD/DVD and give it to a friend or duplicate it otherwise. Sharing copyrighted material becomes illegal when a user shares a piece of copyrighted work over a Peer to Peer (P2P) network, online through other means, physically or otherwise.</h4></div>
Peer to Peer networks (P2P)<div id="left"><h4>P2P networks are the most common way of illegally distributing material online. A P2P network is a network of multiple computers that connect without going through a server. This means that files can be shared directly from computer to computer through the Bittorrent protocol. Bittorrent is a protocol designed to quickly and efficiently share large files over the internet. Bittorrent was originally designed to share legitimate, legal content, but it doesn't discriminate against legal and illegal, pirated files. Because of this, it is often used to distribute illegal media.</div></h4>
<div id="color_two"><h3>How Can You Protect Yourself?</h3></div><div id="left"><h4>You may be surprised but by purchasing an illegitimate copy of copyrighted material, you can be violating copyright law yourself. You can protect yourself by checking the material is from a credible website or store and has the same ballpark price as it is at other locations. This can help because if something is much cheaper than it should be, it could be fake.</h4></div>
