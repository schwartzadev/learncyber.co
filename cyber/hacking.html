<div id="color_two"><h3>What is Hacking?</h3></div><div id="left"><h4>For these purposes, when I say hackers, I am referring to malicious, or "black hat" hackers because there are also "white hat" hackers that test companies' security systems for vulnerabilities by trying to break into them. "Hackers" is a very widely used term, especially by media, but it means a person that exploits computer systems for various reasons.<br>
Hackers are typically looking for money. Other motives have included information gathering and even international espionage, and attacks as a proof of concept to show vulnerabilities or a hacker's abilities. But most of the time, these people are trying to get rich quick. They do this by targeting the low hanging fruit: the people that are very unfamiliar with computers and tend to use "password" as their password.</h4></div><div id="color_two"><h3>How Can You Protect Yourself?</h3></div><div id="left"><h4>To protect yourself from being hacked, don't be the low hanging fruit. I recommend updating your passwords to be a little more complicated if they aren't already. For each character you add to a password, it becomes exponentially more difficult to crack. I also recommend keeping an eye out for suspicious activity on all of your accounts.<br>
If you have been part of a data breach and your information is out there, the attacked company or organization will likely let you know. As soon as you find out, check all of your credit cards for anything out of the ordinary, change your credit card number (if you know which had been attacked) and change your password for the attacked system and any other password that is the same as the stolen one.</h4></div>
