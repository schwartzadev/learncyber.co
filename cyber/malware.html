<div id="color_two"><h3>What is Malware?</h3></div>
<div id="left"><h4>Malware, short for malicious software, and viruses are malicious programs that manipulate your computer or mobile device to do things you don't want them to do. Most malware is made by coders that have a motive like money or information. Because of this, there are classes of viruses like spyware, that watch what a user does and records information like online banking passwords. Another example is ransomware, which takes your computer's data ransom via encryption and then requests sums of money for it to be unencrypted or your personal data will be destroyed. These programs began as harmless pranks and have now evolved to have the capability of targeting high-value computers.<br>There is a whole class of malware called trojan horses. These are malicious programs that are downloaded with software. When a user opens the software package, the software works as expected but also silently opens the malware, compromising your computer.
</h4></div><div id="color_two"><h3>How Can You Protect Yourself?</h3></div>
<div id="left"><h4>Anyone is susceptible to malware but there are two very easy ways to protect yourself and your machine. The first is to install a good, reputable anti-virus software such as Avast (free) or Norton Symantec (paid). These will automatically scan your computer for any threats online or offline so you don't open something that can infect your computer. The second way to protect yourself is to err on the skeptical side when opening email attachments from unknown addresses, downloading files, and browsing websites. To protect yourself from trojan horses, be sure to download all of your software from the actual source. For example, if you are installing Adobe Photoshop, install it from Adobe, not softonic.com or other such websites.</h4></div>
